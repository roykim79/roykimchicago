				<p class="squeeze">
					If you haven't figured it out yet, my name is Roy and I was born and raised in Chicago. I started learning front-end development in the Spring of 2013 at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com">The Starter League </a>and I'm loving it. I'm into all things <a href="http://www.google.com" target='blank'>Google</a>, <a href="http://www.teambuffetusa.com" target='blank'>stuffing my face</a> and playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker" target='blank'>poker</a>. 
				</p>
				<p class="squeeze">
					Despite just starting, I plan on taking the road that leads to being a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> one layer at a time. I am currently very comfortable with <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> but I know my code can be more semantic and D.R.Y. I recently started diving into <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> and I want more. During this short period of time, I have also gained a lot of experience with <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>SCSS</strong> and working in a <strong>Rails</strong> environment, which happens to be next in my queue.

							In hind sight, I think I went overboard with gradients and choosing typefaces is not my forte.

							Happi Labs provides scientist with the data on the lab equipment they use daily. The problem that currently exists is the lack of oversight on purchases combined with the apathy from the scientist who never have to pull out their checkbook. This is where Happi Labs comes in. They provide reviews on products as well as a list of prices from different distributors showing them how much money can be saved by switching vendors.

							I was brought on as a UI engineer to clean up the front-end as well as build out some new features. The difficulty came from the code being passed around so many times and still having fragments of Bootstrap conflicting with styles.

							Inspired by 2 of the most influential designers of the 20th century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames">Charles and Ray Eames</a>, I thought I would give my understanding of the box model a test. The design was pure CSS. If you're still browsing with IE 8 or below, I don't know how you found my site but you probably think its ugly. Graceful degredation was nowhere on my mind when I made this.

							This site will remain in the archives because it was the first site I made after 3 classes at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com">The Starter League</a> and it has sentimental value to me. Ok, I lied, it costs me nothing to keep and host it and my portfolio could use a little more substance. I've only been doing this for 4 months! What more do you want?

							Yes, this is for real. If you actually read this far I'm sure you realized I'm kinda strange and so are my friends. It looks like crap but this is the second site I've every made and I was just trying new things.
						</p>
						<p>
							What's even crazier than the fact that I have a second paragraph on this and actually paid $10 for the domain? I have every intention of building out a new one that I expect will be my Magnum opus for maybe a month. Give me a job and I'll drop this project in a heartbeat.

							If you're struggling with your CSS, it's probably 	your fault. We all have the ability to plan ahead 	but we don't always choose to. As I've been 	learning to write HTML and CSS, my instructors 	always made it a point to bring up best practices 	and it was drilled into my head. Following a good 	order of operations was one of the topics brought 	up.
						</p>
						<p>
							After having an A-HA moment I usually get the itch 	to code. Everything is in a div, I'm bouncing from 	my CSS to my HTML to my browser and refreshing 	after every other line. This is fine when you're 	playing with it, but as the content grows, the 	importance of planning ahead becomes more apparent.	 Your code will be "D.R.Y" and you'll spend less 	time inspecting elements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before firing up sublime, there needs to be some 	sort of wireframe. The more detailed it is, the 	easier the rest of the job will be. Next, markup 	your HTML and make sure all the content is there 	and in the order you want it. If you're happy with 	your results go ahead and style it up. The idea is 	to build everything one layer at a time. It's very 	unlikely to never have to go back and make changes 	but the goal is to minimize the number of times 	this happens. What I'm writing here isn't a secret 	but as you grow in anything, it can be easy to 	forget the basics.

						<p>
						In the past 4 months I've learned much more than I thought I would have. However, of all the things I've learned, learning how to learn was the most important of them all. There's a theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at somthing. Maybe that number is 6,000, maybe it's 15,000. Regardless, I am nowhere near any of those numbers and I have a long way to go. I'm not going to argue on the actual number but more how it's applied to everybody.
						</p>
						<p>
						I know I am definitely lucky to have had good instructors groom me from the beginning. I think the habits you form early will shape the rest of your journey to becoming an expert or not. It pains me to watch someone constantly use the mouse and take 10 seconds to get from their editor to the browser when they can hit 2 keys and get there in a second. Now start counting how many times a day you do that and the numbers start adding up. These are small leaks that add up to a lot of waste in the end.
						</p>
						<p>
						What's the takeaway from this? Well for the 2 people that might actually read this (1 if I exclude myself), in the beginning, focus on best practices. It's much easier to develop a good habit early than to break an old one later. I hate writing blogs but I know it will help me in the end.

						<p class="blog-entry-date">April 1, 2013</p>
					</div>
					<div class="blog-entry-content">
						<p>
						The first thing I did to learn how to code was picking up one of those <i>FOR DUMMIES</i> books on coding and after about 60 pages or so I felt like a dummy. I knew this wasn't going to work. The next thing I did was turn to the most reliable friend I have <a href="http://google.com" target="blank">Larry Page</a>. I learned so much from him and he's always there for me. He referred me to a bunch of free online courses and again, I knew this wasn't going to work. I had to have a real person teach me and looked into different colleges. One night I was talking about this with one of my friends in the field and she told me her co-worker <a href="http://www.shayhowe.com" target="blank">Shay</a> teaches a class in the evenings at this place called code academy. I went to the open house and all the reservations I had about spending $2000 for a 10 week course went out the window.
