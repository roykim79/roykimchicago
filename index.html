				<p class="squeeze">
					If you haven't figured it out yet, my name is Roy and I was born and raised in Chicago. I started learning front-end development in the Spring of 2013 at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com">The Starter League </a>and I'm loving it. I'm into all things <a href="http://www.google.com" target='blank'>Google</a>, <a href="http://www.teambuffetusa.com" target='blank'>stuffing my face</a> and playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker" target='blank'>poker</a>. 
				</p>
				<p class="squeeze">
					Despite just starting, I plan on taking the road that leads to being a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> one layer at a time. I am currently very comfortable with <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> but I know my code can be more semantic and D.R.Y. I recently started diving into <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> and I want more. During this short period of time, I have also gained a lot of experience with <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>SCSS</strong> and working in a <strong>Rails</strong> environment, which happens to be next in my queue.

							Happi Labs provides scientist with the data on the lab equipment they use daily. The problem that currently exists is the lack of oversight on purchases combined with the apathy from the scientist who never have to pull out their checkbook. This is where Happi Labs comes in. They provide reviews on products as well as a list of prices from different distributors showing them how much money can be saved by switching vendors.

							I was brought on as a UI engineer to clean up the front-end as well as build out some new features. The difficulty came from the code being passed around so many times and still having fragments of Bootstrap conflicting with styles. I need to better my understanding of this framework so I can work with it in the future.

							Inspired by 2 of the most influential designers of the 20th century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames">Charles and Ray Eames</a>, I thought I would give my understanding of the box model a test. The design was pure CSS. If you're still browsing with IE 8 or below, I don't know how you found my site but you probably think its ugly. Graceful degredation was nowhere on my mind when I made this.

							Yes, this is for real. If you actually read this far I'm sure you realized I'm kinda strange and so are my friends. It looks like crap but this is the second site I've every made and I was just trying new things.
						</p>
						<p>
							What's even crazier than the fact that I have a second paragraph on this and actually paid $10 for the domain? I have every intention of building out a new one that I expect will be my Magnum opus for maybe a month. Give me a job and I'll drop this project in a heartbeat.

							I recently spent a week volunteering for TechStar's demo day. When I made this decision, I had no idea what I was signing up for other than spending a week with one of the best accelerator programs in the country. I figured this was a great opportunity to learn what it takes to make it in this space and get to meet some people who succeeded in the start-up world. I spent the week with TradingView, a fintech company from Russia, helping with their demo day presentation. I didn't write a single line of code or learn a single thing about front-end development, but I took away a great deal of knowledge I find invaluable.

						<p>
							I was looking for a common thread among the founders and the companies they started. The founders all seemed to follow the mantra Steve Jobs made famous in his Stanford commencement speech: "Stay hungry, stay foolish". They treated the company they built like it was their child and no stone was left unturned when looking for ways to make their company better. The drive and dedication they displayed was motivating and showed me the path I chose was not going to be easy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Being a masochist is only part of the formula to build a successful company, it also takes a big problem and a solution. The common thread I saw was utilizing the power of the internet and all it's data in a meaningful way. The term "Big Data" is everywhere these days and there's a good reason for that. It's true! Data is currency if you know what to do with it. I'm not saying this is a must in order to be successful, but it will definitely be to your advantage to do so. If your company happens to collect a lot of data and does nothing with it, give it to me and I'll use it somehow.

							If you're struggling with your CSS, it's probably 	your fault. We all have the ability to plan ahead 	but we don't always choose to. As I've been 	learning to write HTML and CSS, my instructors 	always made it a point to bring up best practices 	and it was drilled into my head. Following a good 	order of operations was one of the topics brought 	up.
						</p>
						<p>
							After having an A-HA moment I usually get the itch 	to code. Everything is in a div, I'm bouncing from 	my CSS to my HTML to my browser and refreshing 	after every other line. This is fine when you're 	playing with it, but as the content grows, the 	importance of planning ahead becomes more apparent.	 Your code will be "D.R.Y" and you'll spend less 	time inspecting elements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before firing up sublime, there needs to be some 	sort of wireframe. The more detailed it is, the 	easier the rest of the job will be. Next, markup 	your HTML and make sure all the content is there 	and in the order you want it. If you're happy with 	your results go ahead and style it up. The idea is 	to build everything one layer at a time. It's very 	unlikely to never have to go back and make changes 	but the goal is to minimize the number of times 	this happens. What I'm writing here isn't a secret 	but as you grow in anything, it can be easy to 	forget the basics.

						In the past 4 months I've learned much more than I thought I would have. However, of all the things I've learned, learning how to learn was the most important of them all. Building a solid foundation early will yield much greater results than if you didn't. There's a theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at somthing. Maybe that number is 6,000, maybe it's 15,000. Regardless, I am nowhere near any of those numbers and I have a long way to go. I'm not going to argue on the actual number of hours it takes but more on the fact it's applied to everybody.
						</p>
						<p>
						I was definitely lucky to have had good instructors groom me from the beginning. When coding there are many ways to attack a project but some way are better than others. What I am referring to are best practices. If you take the time to learn them and apply them, those 10,000 hours will be spent building things while learning and not wasted fixing your broken code. If you practice poor CSS, you could end up spending hours looking for a needle in a haystack pulling your hair out at the same time.
						</p>
						<p>
						So my advice to a developer in development such as myself, learn best practices as soon as possible. You will be saving yourself time and be hours upon hours ahead of your peers.

					<div class="blog-entry-content">
						<p>
						The first thing I did to learn how to code was picking up one of those <i>FOR DUMMIES</i> books on coding and after about 60 pages or so I felt like a dummy. I knew this wasn't going to work. The next thing I did was turn to the most reliable friend I have <a href="http://google.com" target="blank">Larry Page</a>. I learned so much from him and he's always there for me. He referred me to a bunch of free online courses and again, I knew this wasn't going to work. I had to have a real person teach me and looked into different colleges. One night I was talking about this with one of my friends in the field and she told me her co-worker <a href="http://www.shayhowe.com" target="blank">Shay</a> teaches a class in the evenings at this place called code academy. I went to the open house and all the reservations I had about spending $2000 for a 10 week course went out the window.
